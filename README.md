github_cleaner
==============

Utility to tidy up a github account.   Good for those who fork and forget.   
Delete repos you have forked and then did nothing with....

Notes
------

1. To get deleting to work
    1. The ~/.github file needs to have username & password (not oauth)
    1. Two factor authentication needs to be turned off.  
    (or something fancier than this stuff needs to be done).
